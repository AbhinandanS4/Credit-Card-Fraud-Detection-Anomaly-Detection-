ðŸ“˜ Skills/Knowledge Required:
To understand and execute this program, you should be familiar with:

1. Python Programming Basics
Variables, functions, and modules.

Importing and using external libraries.

2. Data Manipulation with Pandas
Reading .csv files, filtering data, handling missing values.

3. Numerical Computing with NumPy
Arrays, vectorized operations, reshaping data.

4. Data Visualization
Creating plots with matplotlib and seaborn (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps).

5. Machine Learning with scikit-learn
StandardScaler: to normalize feature scales.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): for dimensionality reduction.

Isolation Forest & Local Outlier Factor: for anomaly/outlier detection.
6. Unsupervised Learning
Understanding how to detect patterns in data without labeled outcomes.

Applying clustering and anomaly detection techniques.

Evaluating models that learn from inherent data structure instead of target labels.

7. Basic Statistics and Linear Algebra
Concepts like mean, standard deviation, covariance, and eigenvalues (for PCA understanding).
